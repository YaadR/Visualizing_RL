## Project description:
Visualizing how different agents perceives their environment in the game Snake : algorithms in Reinforcement Learning



## Algorithms:
### Value-Based:

#### Evaluation after X games played:




### Policy-Based:


#### Evaluation after X games played:


### Agent-Critic:


#### Evaluation after X games played:




## Snakes in an Arena
####After each alorithim ran and learned  
###X vs Y
