### Project description:
Visualizing how different agents perceives their environment in the game Snake : algorithms in Reinforcement Learning



### Algorithms:
#### Value-Based:

the Bellman equation to compute the value at each iteration:
$$V(S_t) = V(S_t) + \alpha \left[ R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) \right]$$


##### Evaluation after X games played:

The Bellman equation is:

$$
V(s) = \max_a \left( R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s' | s,a) V(s') \right)
$$



### Policy-Based:

#### Evaluation after X games played:


### Agent-Critic:
